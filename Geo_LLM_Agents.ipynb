            "A panda bear, often simply referred to as a panda, is a species of bear native to central China. Scientifically known as *Ailuropoda melanoleuca*, the panda is one of the most distinctive and recognizable animals in the world due to its black and white coat. Here are some key facts about panda bears:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Physical Characteristics**:  \n",
            "   - Pandas have a stocky body, round face, and black patches around their eyes, ears, and across their body.  \n",
            "   - Adults typically weigh between 70 to 125 kilograms (150 to 275 pounds) and stand about 75 to 80 centimeters (30 inches) tall at the shoulder.  \n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Diet**:  \n",
            "   - Pandas are primarily herbivores, with bamboo making up about 99% of their diet. They may occasionally eat other vegetation, small animals, or fish.  \n",
            "   - An adult panda can eat up to 12–38 kilograms (26–84 pounds) of bamboo daily.  \n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Habitat**:  \n",
            "   - Pandas live in temperate forests in the mountains of central China, primarily in Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces.  \n",
            "   - They prefer areas with dense bamboo growth and access to water.  \n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Behavior**:  \n",
            "   - Pandas are generally solitary animals, except during the brief mating season.  \n",
            "   - They are excellent climbers and spend much of their time in trees, especially when resting or escaping predators.  \n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Conservation Status**:  \n",
            "   - Pandas were previously classified as \"Endangered\" but were downgraded to \"Vulnerable\" in 2016 by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to successful conservation efforts.  \n",
            "   - Threats include habitat loss, poaching, and low reproductive rates.  \n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Reproduction**:  \n",
            "   - Pandas have a low reproductive rate, with females typically giving birth to one or two cubs after a gestation period of about 95–160 days.  \n",
            "   - Cubs are born blind and helpless, and they remain dependent on their mother for up to 18 months.  \n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Cultural Significance**:  \n",
            "   - Pandas are a national symbol of China and are often seen as a global icon for conservation efforts.  \n",
            "   - They are also popular in zoos worldwide, where they attract millions of visitors.  \n",
            "\n",
            "Pandas are beloved for their gentle nature and unique appearance, making them a focal point of wildlife conservation and research.\n"
